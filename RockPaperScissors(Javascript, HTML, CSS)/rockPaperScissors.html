<!--The purpose of this code is to use javascript's booleans to create a rock paper scissors game.
NOTE: The rock button is bugged but everything else works fine.
-On our functions lecture, we created functions to clean up our code.
-One thing to know about functions is the idea of variable usage and scopes apply in
javascript as well. Variables that can be accessed anywhere are called global variables.
-Another thing to know is that to create void functions/methods, just omit the return statement
as you would in any other program.
-From the objects lecture, we used the localstorage integrated object to permanently save certain data in
our webpage. 
-From the DOM(Document Object Model) lecture, we used the document object in Javascript to update our Rock Paper Scissors 
game, and added other html elements to improve the UI.
-From the HTML,CSS, Javascript together lecture, we added css on our buttons to add icons that represent rock, paper, and 
scissors respectively.
-In this lecture, we also talked about the process of separating our code into separate files. One thing to know
is that the file extension for javascript code files is .js. To link your javascript files, you use the src html attribute
on the html script tag. Next, you simply enter the filepath in the attribute value. Also, as you should know from the
html and css lecture, you can creates css files and link them using the html link tag accompanied by the href html attribute.
-MOST IMPORTANTLY, when creating webpages/websites, it is wise to code what you can on one file, AND then @ the end organize
it in their neccessary files, and link them using the html attribute src with the script tag(for js files) and the link tag(for css files)
respectively.
-In the Advanced Functions lecture, we implemented an auto play button. The button works as intended, but the results are not printing
out they are supposed to. Whenever you are reviewing this material, make an attempt to fix this issue.
