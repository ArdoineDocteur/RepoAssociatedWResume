### Personal Projects

#### [CssEditorTerminal : Python](https://github.com/ArdoineDocteur/RepoAssociatedWResume/tree/main/CssEditorTerminal(Python))

Purpose: Create a Terminal System for modifying the appearance of a HTML file.

1) First you must figure out the command args you would like to use 
to make certain changes to the appearance such as 
background color, text color, etc. 
Also may need to figure out the command arg needed 
to target certain lines of code in a css file.

2) Figure out the REGEX required to target css code.
 
3) Think of the modification features that you will provide, 
and the menu blueprint to output to the user. NOTE: Thinking about using the command line 
where the user enters the filepath to the html file of their choosing.

4) If you'd like, you can create a class that contains a 
css selector selection and an array[list] of modifcations 
for that particular css selection.

#### [Guessing Game : C++](https://github.com/ArdoineDocteur/RepoAssociatedWResume/tree/main/GuessingGame(c%2B%2B))

Purpose: Created a guessing game using dynamic memory allocation through the use of unique pointers using C++

Subobjectives:
- 1) Create a user environment that directly tells the user the req instructions
- 2) Use an unique pointer array to output the user's entries.
Ideas:
- Will make unique pointer array of type int.
- Initial plan is to write everything in main method. After the logic is implemented correctly, I will split the code
into files, and WILL create a makefile for running the program as well.
- Make sure to explain the coding logic effectively using a decent amount of comments.
- Going to make a simple makefile for the project as well.
- IMPT: May have to consider a case where user inputs another data type other than a number. Will use a try and catch block for that.
