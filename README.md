1) First you must figure out the command args you would like to use 
to make certain changes to the appearance such as 
background color, text color, etc. 
Also may need to figure out the command arg needed 
to target certain lines of code in a css file.

2) Figure out the REGEX required to target css code.
 
3) Think of the modification features that you will provide, 
and the menu blueprint to output to the user. NOTE: Thinking about using the command line 
where the user enters the filepath to the html file of their choosing.

4) If you'd like, you can create a class that contains a 
css selector selection and an array[list] of modifcations 
for that particular css selection.

```
#### [Guessing Game : C++](https://github.com/ArdoineDocteur/RepoAssociatedWResume/tree/main/GuessingGame(c%2B%2B))

Purpose: Created a guessing game using dynamic memory allocation through the use of unique pointers using C++
```txt
Abstract Representation of vision for project

Subobjectives:
- 1) Create a user environment that directly tells the user the req instructions
- 2) Use an unique pointer array to output the user's entries.
Ideas:
- Will make unique pointer array of type int.
- Initial plan is to write everything in main method. After the logic is implemented correctly, I will split the code
into files, and WILL create a makefile for running the program as well.
- Make sure to explain the coding logic effectively using a decent amount of comments.
- Going to make a simple makefile for the project as well.
- IMPT: May have to consider a case where user inputs another data type other than a number. Will use a try and catch block for that.
```
#### [YatzeeGame : C++](https://github.com/ArdoineDocteur/RepoAssociatedWResume/tree/main/YatzeeGame(C%2B%2B))

Purpose: Created a Console Application version of the famous Yatzee Board Game. 

[Personal Note]: <> "Need to figure out how to incorporate project from ELCT 201 in school projects and mention how this application was repurposed. Also, need to consider getting subset of slides that references repurposing of this software. "
#### [Chore App : MERN](https://github.com/Darnell-Chen/SMS-RemindR)
- Brief Description: SMS RemindR is a web app that allows you to schedule notifications via SMS, Email, and Discord. Built using the MERN stack, it features both a backend and frontend framework to ensure seamless operation and user experience.


#### [Grocery Sales Web Scraper: Python][IP]

Purpose: Creating a web scraping project using Python that can help people save money when they go to the grocery store. This project benefits those who are regular IGA Grocery Shoppers.

1) The first step is to find an integrated python module that allows you to use some sort of querying system, that is similar to Javascript, with the exception that you can provide a link to a website to be that dynamic DOM object to query in.[Link to article that talks about 7 libraries that are useful for web scraping: https://www.projectpro.io/article/python-libraries-for-web-scraping/625#:~:text=Requests%2C%20BeautifulSoup%2C%20Scrapy%2C%20and,for%20web%20scraping%20in%20Python.]
2) After this, take the time to surf the website and find information of importance that is uploaded daily. Once this is found, understand the purpose of the display and then create a class that allows you to display this information in a more linear way.
3) Once the object is created, use the web scraping, by targeting certain information to create objects that are formatted in a format that can be displayed in tabular or tab-delimited format in a text file.
4) Once the data is formatted, create a search engine, using REGEX, which is responsible for pulling up data that is relative to the data retreived from the website.

[Personal Note]: <> "Can Make Project Title into a hyperlink referencing the directory containing the project. Inside of that directory, I can display my roadmap as a markdown document. The markdown document can also contain the instructions to run the project. If the roadmap wasn't used for the project, then I can go to project executables directory and derive my pre-alpha roadmap from there."

#### [ Task Manager : MERN Stack][IP]

Purpose: Create a task manager program using React.js for the frontend, and using MongoDB as the database for the Task Manager.
```txt
Abstract Representation of Vision for Project
1) Before you start coding, draw your blueprint on paper or using google drawing(complete, blueprint in green folder in blue bookbag)
2) Ensure that you have the neccessary HTML/JSX markup that fulfills your needs as far as blueprints[Implement in html first, and then use the JSX converter online]
3) Figure out what each button's purpose will be[could be useful to think of some simple things such as checking for amount of tasks, checking the priority of tasks,(add more features here as ideas come along]
4) Figure out the custom objects you may need, the data structure you want to use, and implement these via javascript for your backend dev. IMPT: Based on the purpose of this idea, I believe using a Min Heap or a BST could be extremely useful. Therefore, refer to blue CSCE 146 notebook and the data structures directory from that class for more information. a) Once you know what objects you may need, create a UML diagram before you begin coding. It is highly recommended to create the classes needed, along with their member functions, in the .ts or .js file, and then create the UML diagram from there.
5) Once the blueprint is established, implement minute features such as transitions to make the UI feel satisfying through the use of css and
,if possible, use JQuery.
6) Once subobjective 4) is completed, then I need to figure out the tables that I will
need for my database so that user data is properly handled, and its access is seemless.

#### [TeachMe : MERN Stack][IP]

Purpose: Build an app specifically for keeping track of both tutors, clients and their respective needs---

### School Projects 

#### [Geometric Shape Generator : C++](https://github.com/ArdoineDocteur/RepoAssociatedWResume/tree/main/Geometric%20Shape%20Generator(C%2B%2B))

Objective: [Implement three classes to output geometric shapes in the
CSCE240_Program6 namespace](https://github.com/ArdoineDocteur/RepoAssociatedWResume/blob/main/Geometric%20Shape%20Generator(C%2B%2B)/Programming-Assignment-6.pdf)

[Personal Note]: <> "Thought about having readme files in the respective project dirs that have instructions for testing out the respective programs. Thought about utilizing docker skills by making dockerfiles for setting up envs, as well as utilizing scripting skills to have program execution be seamless and handless for testing out[will revise later, but you should get the point]"
