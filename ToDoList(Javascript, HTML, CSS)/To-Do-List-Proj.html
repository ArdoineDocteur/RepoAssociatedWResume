<!--More Notes about Arrays and Loops in Javascript
-In this project, we created an array to store the tasks, and used the text box to get the data to store inside of the 
task object.
-Also, we used loops to add all of the tasks that a user adds, and display them on the screen.
-With experience learning, I learned that you can create custom objects that contain multiple modifiable properties like you
would create them in java or other langauges. This is done by creating a function, parameterizing its constructors with the
property ids that you want and then creating the instance variables using the self-referential pointer aka the 'this' keyword.
Once this is done, you can make instances of your custom object, as you would in java, by using the 'new' keyword. Syntax for
making a new instance of your custom object in javascript: let <<new inst id>>= new <<custom object id>>(<<optional property entries for params>>);
Refer to the code below for two examples involving this.
-As of 6/20/23, the fundamental part of the project is finished. If you would like, you can modify the css code to give the project
more unity.
-NOTE: In the advanced functions lecture, we added a keydown feature which allows the user to add tasks using the enter key.
